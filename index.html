			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p>
				I was born and raised in Calgary, Canada and developed an interest in computers at a young age. Growing up, I spent weekends and summers taking programming classes and reading books on software development. I eventually narrowed my focus to how humans use computers to tell stories, create fictional worlds, and share emotional experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my undergraduate education at Emerson College in Boston, receiving a BFA in Writing &amp; Literature and a B.Sc. in Political Communication with honors. Pursuing my passion for understanding digital media in a social context, I received an MA in Emerging Media Studies from Boston University and am currently working on completing my PhD.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I am not researching or teaching, I can either be found hiking, snowshoeing, or kayaking in the Great Outdoors, or playing video games, constructing virtual experiences, or writing and performing poetry in a basement somewhere.

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>
				My research focuses on understanding how users process <em>immersive environments</em> and <em>interactive narratives</em> on cognitive and emotional levels. I conduct psychological experiments in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/com/research/communication-research-center/" target="_blank">Communication Research Center</a> using video games and virtual reality technology. In the past, I have drawn from both commercially-available and custom-designed entertainment software to form the basis of the stimuli I use.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also conduct resarch on online harassment and cyberbullying, particularly within online communities and subcultures, with the aim of making gaming culture less toxic while also promoting a free exchange of ideas.

			<h2>Teaching</h2>
			<p>
				In the context of <span id="course-title">EM757 Developing Interactivity</span>, I will primarily be facilitating the more technical aspects of the course, including:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>Content Management Systems</li>
				<li>Principles of Modern Web Design</li>
				<li>Web Server Management</li>
			</ul>
			<p> 
				I am on hand for any questions that students may have regarding the content of the course, and am happy to help resolve any issues you may have, or just to give feedback on your code before you turn it in for a grade!
